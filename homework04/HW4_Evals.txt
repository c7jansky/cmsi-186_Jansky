======================================================

The Ball.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes at least four arguments for the x, y, dx, and dy values.  There
must be some sort of "move()" method.  There may be some sort of
"updateSpeed()" method but the computation may be done in move() with
no penalty.  There must be a "toString()" method to display the info
about the ball's location and speed.  There should be an "outOfBounds()"
method, but the computation may be done in the SoccerSim class instead.

The Timer.java or Clock.java class is optional.  If it exists, there is
one point each for the methods listed and any tests included.  Otherwise
this is a freebie, but the functionality of the computations MUST show
up in the SoccerSim.java class file somewhere/somehow.

The SoccerSim.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor
that initializes the simulation.  If the initialization is done in some
other method, that is OK, and credit is given for the constructor.  There
must be some method of validating arguments.  This may be done using the
provided method "validateArgs()" or can be done in the main() method if
that is desired.  There must be some kind of report facility, which can
be either a method "report()" [or similar name], or can be done directly
in the simulation loop in another way.  There needs to be a facility to
detect collisions, which may be either a method like "collisionCheck()"
or can be done directly in the simulation loop.  There must be a main()
method which takes in and handles the argument checking, either directly
or through a method call to something like "validateArgs()".  There are
four points total [1 point for each] awarded for argument checking, which
covers:

   - right number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion (no letters)
   - time slice set to default if not on command line
   - time slice validated and set properly if it IS on the command line

Testing includes trials that should show ball[s] come to rest, should
show two balls colliding, and three others to show the balls all go off
the field, all come to a stop, and various ball counts are handled in
the output; the last three are worth a total of three points.

There must be at least two files in the repo: the Ball.java and the
SoccerSim.java files.  If there is a Timer/Clock.java file it is
ignored for credit since it was optional, AS LONG AS THE FUNCTIONALITY
IS AVAILABLE in one of the other two classes.

YOUR SCORE:  36 out of 37 = 100% which is an A-plus

Detailed omments:
=================
Chris, your Ball.java file didn't compile.  There was one error at line 54,
which I corrected for you by changing the variable name "currPosition" to
"currLocation" which was what was defined.  That correction revealed another
error at line 43, where you have a call to "System.exit()" after you have
thrown a new exception, which makes the exit() call unreachable.  I fixed
that by commenting in out and now your Ball.java code compiles.

There is no main in your Ball.java file so there are no tests for the Ball
class.

Your SoccerSim.java file didn't compile either.  At the first attemt, there
were 80 errors.  At lines 34 and 35 you define variable names that are not
allowed.  Variables in Java [or most any other languag] cannot start with a
number, so "1collision" is an illegal name.  You can put the number AFTER
the rest of the name, which I did to fix that error.  That dropped the error
count to 68.

You did the same thing starting down around line 117, with "1ball".  I fixed
those as well.  That dropped the compile error count to 2.  Both of these I
fixed for you also, inserting a missing close curly brace at line 67 and a
missing semicolon at line 137.

After that, recompiling still shows up 35 errors.  It appears that every time
I fix errors for you, it allows the compiler to get a bit farther in its
process, which uncovers even more errors in your code.  At this point I'll
have to stop trying to fix things for you and suggest that you spend a little
more time with this exercise.

I can give you partial credit for the code you HAVE written, as I did in the
previous exercise.  Since the code won't compile, there isn't much more I can
do on this assignment for you.

I'm available to help you, Chris... feel free to talk to me during office
hours any time, or log in to the discord channels for help from a Computer
Science TA.  There are also probably tutors available through the Academic
Resource Center.  Please don't be shy about reaching out to me... your
success is important to me!
